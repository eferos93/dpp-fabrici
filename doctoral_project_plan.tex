%The Doctorate Project Plan (DPP), Thesis Proposal Report (TPR), and Research Progress Report (RPR) constitute a tool for directing the development of a  doctorate process. It helps to formulate and concretise different elements involved in the process. It is also meant as a communication tool among the doctoral candidate, his/her co-supervisors, and the Candidate Progress Committee (CPC).  From an administrative viewpoint, it is a tool for evaluating the extent to which the proposed research can be realised within the framework of a doctorate study. Therefore, this tool will be used for the candidate's evaluation in the four milestones M1--M4.

%The DPP has to be submitted to the chair of the CPC no later than two months after the start of the studies (M1). The DPP should include the initial plan of the doctorate project, as well as the preliminary overview of the literature in the studied field, which should further lead to concretise the specific project topic. It is expected that the co-supervisors lead the production of the plan.
%In the TPR, the DPP is updated by the candidate according to the experiences gained during the beginning phase of the project. It is expected that the TPR is much more concrete and elaborated than the DPP. The TPR should propose a specific path for the rest of the doctorate project, including concrete topics to be studied, tentative list of expected publications, doctorate training, external co-operation, and other activities to be completed during the project. The TPR should be sent to the chair of the CPC no later than one month before the end of the first academic year (M2). In the RPR, the TPR is updated by the candidate, reporting the results, and the completed activities (e.g., publications, doctorate training, external co-operations) during the doctorate project. The RPR should be sent to the chair of the CPC no later than one month before the end of the second academic year (M3). Finally, the Doctoral Thesis will be submitted at the end of the third year (M4).

%The following sections contain the elements that are to be present in the DPP, TPR, and RPR. The DPP should be specific and as short as possible while still containing the necessary information. Sections 1--6 and 8 should in total not exceed 10 pages (12 point Times New Roman, 20 mm margins on all sides).
%The template form at the end of this document must be filled out and handed in along with the doctorate plan/report, to be added to the portfolio of the candidate.

For guidelines see, for example, the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity\footnote{\url{http://www.esf.org/fileadmin/Public_documents/Publications/Code_Conduct_ResearchIntegrity.pdf}}, the Singapore Statement\footnote{\url{http://www.singaporestatement.org/}}, and similar sources.

\section{Project Summary}
The term Big Data refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data processing software. 
In particular, Big Data captures to 4 dimensions: Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Volume. This large quantity of data available nowadays has 
a lot of statistical and business value, therefore their analysis is of core importance for business decision-making. Nevertheless, the data 
involved in those processes contains a lot of sensitive information regarding individuals (e.g. health sector). There is therefore also the need to 
guarantee the privacy of the individuals while being able to extract insights and patterns from the data. 

Data Integration is the set of processes to gather and bridge data from heterogeneous sources together in order to 
have a unified view. The premise of data integration is to make data more freely available and easier 
to consume and process by systems and users.
Research on Data Integration started more than 50 years ago \cite*{recordLinkTheory,dataModelIntegration1980} but as we entered the Big Data era, new challenges arose,
 which include scaling \cite*{Dong2013} data integration while guaranteeing the privacy \cite*{yu2016big, Gkoulalas-Divanis2021} of the individuals involved in the datasets.
Over the last decade new techniques have been applied for improving computational performance, consisting of the use of parallelizing the computation by using big data processing platforms \cite*{Dong2013},
 or algorithmically, namely using summarization techniques \cite*{Cormode2011}, used for 
approximate fast and approximate querying, improving the performance of Machine Learning processes \cite*{Gribonval2020, Antonanzas2021, Jiang2018} as well as in some data integration scenarios.
Despite the progress made, it is difficult to combine efficiency (the integration is completed with no, or very few, errors), computational performance and privacy altogether \cite*{He2017}. 

%Analyzing Big Data may involve accessing sensitive information, especially in the health sector. For these reasons, in Data Integration, 
%techniques like Secure Multi-Party Computation and Differential Privacy \cite*{Dwork2013} have been used. One big concern in private Data Integration is that it is 
%difficult to guarantee privacy, accuracy, and good performance at the same time.

Machine Learning and Data Integration have really close relationship \cite*{Dong2019}. In particular, it is possible to leverage the first to improve the performance of the second
and vice-versa. An evolving branch of Machine Learning is Federated Learning, which consists in building a Machine Learning model in a federated setting (when the data is distributed across
 edge devices) and model in a collaborative way, without moving the data to a central server.

 This Ph.D. aims to explore algorithms, data structures and Federated Learning for scaling Data Integration tasks while guaranteeing privacy and achieving good performance.

\section{Scientific Content of the Doctorate Project}
\subsection{Background}
\subsubsection{Data Integration}
Data Integration (DI) is the practice of consolidating data from disparate sources into a unified view. It has been studied since the birth relational databases. 
It is characterized by three main steps: 
\begin{enumerate}
   \item \textbf{Schema alignment}, a process that takes as input a set of different schemas on the same domain an outputs a \textit{mediated schema}, an \textit{attribute matching} and a \textit{schema mapping}.
   \item \textbf{Record linkage}, also referred as entity resolution, computes a partitioning of the set of records from different datasets, such that each partition identifies the records that refer to a distinct entity.
   \item \textbf{Data fusion} aim is to identify which are the best records to represent a specific entity, when a source provide conflicting values.
\end{enumerate}

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item The background for the project problem should be described (maximum 300 words).
%\item An introduction stating the state of the art for the doctorate project. The introduction should include key references listed under Section 7. Typically, at least 10-15 references to peer-reviewed scientific material are expected. In case it is necessary to refer to non-peer-reviewed material then use a footnote (or parenthesis) to provide information to the source. Explain the relevance of the present doctorate project so the scientific contribution will be evident -- i.e., explain how the project advances current state-of-the-art. Scientific challenges should be clearly defined -- do not mistake this for technological challenges.
\subsubsection{Federated Learning}
Federated Learning is a machine learning approach where a model is trained across multiple decentralized edge-devices, in an edge computing fashion. Each device trains a local model and then, 
either in a centralized, decentralized or heterogeneous approach, build a global model. It differs from a distributed machine learning as the data is not expected to be identically distributed.
Besides the advantage of having a distributed computation, guaranteeing more efficiency, it gained a lot of popularity due to the fact that data is not exchanged between the parts involved, thus guaranteeing privacy.

It has gained a lot of popularity both in research and industry, in particular in transportation \cite*{Elbir2020}, Industry 4.0 \cite*{Shubyn2022} and digital health \cite*{Prayitno2021}.
\subsubsection{Differential Privacy \& Synopses for Big Data}
Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique for sharing datasets' information without compromising the privacy of the individuals. The idea is to add noise to the data such that the new distribution is close 
to the real one, but not equal. 

Synopses or summaries are a set of technique and probabilistic data structures to compute compact description of big datasets. They gained a lot of popularity over the last decade due to the rise of Big Data.

\subsection{State of the Art}
\subsubsection{Privacy-aware Data Integration in the Big Data Era}
Privacy in the context of data management has gained a lot of popularity over the last decade, as public awareness about issues in management sensitive data increased. Due two this,
privacy became of central importance in the field of Big Data Management, analytics and processing.

In the particular case of Data Integration, privacy-preserving techniques
has been used extensively in literature, especially for record linkage. In particular, differentially-private record linkage and cryptography has
been used extensively \cite*{Khurram2020,Vatsalan2017, Clifton, Kuzu2013, Gkoulalas-Divanis2021, Nobrega2021, Bonomi2012, Kuzu2013}. 
As regards schema matching and data fusion, there are fewer works on guaranteeing privacy, most of the work is based on guaranteeing efficiency, by using 
both rule-based and learning-based approaches \cite*{Rodrigues2021,Riedel2013,Saleem2009}.


\paragraph{Schema matching.}
Schema matching aligns attributes and data types. It is one of the oldest problems studied for data integration and the 
traditional approaches consist in extracting knowledge according to a predefined schema. They can be categorized as it follows:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Schema-level matchers}, where only the metadata is considered (e.g. column labels, data-types). Linguistic matching is mostly used here (stemming, tokenization, etc.) \cite*{Bernstein2011}.
   \item \textbf{Instance-level matchers}, where the content of the columns is used for matching by using probabilistic approaches \cite*{Szymczak2016, Dasu2002} or rule-based approaches.
   \item \textbf{Hybrid matchers} that combine the two matchers just described.
\end{itemize}

In schema matching the problem of \textit{volume} have to be taken into account only in few specific cases, for example when we consider millions sources from the web \cite*{Pimplikar2012}, but not in typical DI scenarios, 
where the number of sources is limited.
Universal Schema \cite*{Riedel2013} has revolutionized schema alignment. It consists in extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples, where the predicate can be any word or phrase from texts and instead of outputting 
mappings between predicates, it adds inferred triples. This is done through matrix factorization \cite*{Riedel2013}, while recently it is improved by using 
Recurrent Neural Networks \cite*{Das2016,Nee2015}.

For what we know so far, there is no work in literature regarding privacy-aware schema matching. This because most of the techniques are based on the schemas' metadata. 
Nevertheless, if Instance-level approaches are used, it may be useful to use techniques for guaranteeing the privacy of the individuals, e.g. differential privacy.

%namely there is no need to increase computational performance, rather 
%exploring new techniques for having more precise matchers could be necessary. Nevertheless, the availability of big data, brought recent 
%research towards \textbf{learning-based} matchers, where pre-existing mappings are used to train machine learning algorithms that 



\paragraph{Record linkage.}
Record Linkage, also called Entity Resolution, consists in finding records, among different data sources, that refers to the same real world entity. 
It is the most important problem in integrating data from different sources. 

Generally, it proceeds in three steps: 
\begin{enumerate}
   \item \textbf{blocking records} that are likely to be a match;
   \item \textbf{compare pairs of records} to decide if it's a match;
   \item \textbf{clustering records} according to the previous step's results.
\end{enumerate}

Approaches consisted mostly in rule-based techniques \cite*{recordLinkTheory, Gal2011} for the first two steps, while for clustering either 
rule-based or optimizing a particular objective function \cite*{Hass2009}. 

Recently, supervised learning approaches (e.g. Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forest) showed to obtain high precision and recall \cite*{Das2017}, 
at the cost of generating training labels, i.e. to obtain a precision and recall of 99\% on linking a pair of datasets, 1.5M training labels are required \cite*{Dong2018}.

Performance and efficiency is not only the main concern of Record Linkage. In a real-world scenario, the data involved in the linkage may be sensitive, and methods to guarantee 
the privacy of the individuals is a major concern. Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL) identifies the set of techniques that aim to link different datasets in 
a privacy-preserving manner.
Initially, Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) techniques were used, in particular, the Paillier crypto-system \cite*{paillier1999public}. 
These protocols are reliable and very effective, with the downside of a very prohibitive computational cost. 
In other to improve performance, by applying secure transformations to the data \cite*{Bonomi2013}, such as embedding records to different spaces and then mining them with differential privacy.
This comes with the cost of having less accurate results. 

Generally, the PPRL protocols proposed for secure two-party private record linkage are not able to meet the following three requirements altogether, without making strict assumptions: 
(1) \textbf{full end-to-end privacy}, 
(2) \textbf{perfect precision and recall} for the matching records and (3) \textbf{sub-quadratic computational complexity} \cite*{He2017, Groce2019}. 
%After \cite*{He2017} pointed out this problem, new approaches were proposed and resulted in meeting all the three requirements described above \cite*{Groce2019}, 
%but still limited to certain adversarial models, that do not match well with real world scenarios (e.g. \textit{honest-but-curious}), 
Moreover, multi-party PPRL is a more realistic scenario and only in the last years it has been tackled, with still limited results \cite*{Vatsalan2016, Vatsalan2017, Vatsalan2020}.
%Although there have been many prior works that looked into different security and privacy aspects of PPRL \cite*{Gkoulalas-Divanis2021}, there still remain major challenges that need to be addressed. 
%For example, inference
%For example, a malicious party may create many random records with the intent of matching with the other parties' actual records \cite*{Gkoulalas-Divanis2021}. 
%To tackle this problem, blockchain technologies are recently being proposed in literature \cite*{Nobrega2021}.

\paragraph{Data Fusion.} Data fusion resolves conflicts between different data sources, by selecting the best record per entity. 
Access to highly accurate data is critical for industry applications, such as knowledge graph search, so data fusion is often 
an important step in data integration.

The main methods for data fusion are rule-based \cite*{dong2009data} and also data-mining based \cite*{Pas2010}. 
Graphical models are also used in this context \cite*{Gao2016} as well as semi-unsupervised approaches \cite*{Reka2017}.

Privacy-preserving data fusion has not been studied deeply in literature. There are a few context specific works, for example \cite*{DING2019129} 
identifies privacy issues and future research directions for data fusion in Internet-Of-Things and \cite*{Gati2021} which focuses on Differential Privacy in the 
context of Cyber-Physical Systems.

\subsubsection{Federated Learning}
Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed by Google \cite*{Kon2016}. The idea is to build a global ML model from datasets that are 
distributed across edge devices, without moving the data. 
An unbalanced and non-IID (identically and independently distributed) data partitioning across a massive number of unreliable 
devices with limited communication bandwidth was introduced as the defining set of challenges \cite*{Kairouz2021}.
%TODO add references in this paragraph
Privacy is one of the essential properties of FL. Many techniques exist in literature (e.g. Secure Multiparty Computation, homomorphic encryption), but 
\textbf{Differential Privacy} represents \textit{de facto} standard for Privacy in many areas (querying, synthetic data generation, etc.) as it guarantees a 
better computational performance rather than cryptographic approaches.

%\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Section 3. Co-supervisors/Candidate Co-operation Agreements}
The project will be carried out in three years during which the PhD student will stay in one research institution and one university. During the first and the third year, the candidate will work in Athena Research Center (ARC) under the supervision of Prof. Minos Garofalakis (ARC). During the second year, the program
will take place in Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC) under the supervision of Prof. Oscar Romero (UPC). The project will be a joint work of all parties, hence close co-operation is expected in the following way.

The progress of the project will be validated through frequent meetings between the candidate and his supervisors. The candidate will meet on a weekly basis with his home supervisor and one or two times per month with his host supervisor (the opposite when he will be hosted at UPC). Following typical business practice, the expectations and tasks planned for each meeting will be clearly communicated in advance, with a reasonable notice, both from the supervisors to the candidate and vice-versa. Standard tools of the trade will be used to boost collaboration, such
as a shared repository for documents and code artifacts (e.g., Mendeley Library, Github), communication platforms (e.g. Skype, Teams).

%The DEDS programme expects that the co-supervisor and candidate should meet (face to face if possible) at least once every other week.
%Each of these working meetings should produce minutes drafted by the candidate stating:
%(1) what was done since last meeting,
%(2) what will be done before next meeting,
%(3) what is slowing down or blocking the project, and
%(4) what was discovered that would be of interest, or needs to be discussed.

%In addition, periodic monitoring meetings are planned just before moving from one university of the co-tutelle to the other.
%These teleconference (e.g., skype) meetings involving the candidate and both co-supervisors allow doctoral candidates to present their results, ask questions, prepare the next stay, etc.
%Minutes of these meetings are drafted by the candidate in a Periodic Evaluation Form, reviewed by the local supervisor, and added to the candidate's portfolio.%allowing the CPC an efficient quality control and monitoring.

%Please detail the agreement on the relationship between the co-supervisors and the candidate (meeting frequency, communication forms, mutual expectations, etc.).

\subsection*{Section 4. Proposed Education and Training Programme}

The DEDS education and training programme is composed of several activities.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Research}, where doctoral candidates work on a novel research problem 
guided by two supervisors who will advise them to gradually become independent researchers.
\item \textbf{Research-specific courses}, aimed at providing doctoral candidates with focused
state-of-the art technical skills pertaining to their research topic.
\item \textbf{Innovation and entrepreneurship courses}, aimed at complementing the scientific training
of doctoral candidates with business-related aspects such as entrepreneurship,
intellectual property rights, etc.
\item \textbf{Methodological and communication courses}, aimed at introducing the necessary
research methods and communication skills.
\item \textbf{Language courses}, aimed at introducing the local language at each partner university.
\item \textbf{Summer and winter schools}, wherein candidates will obtain 
feedback about their research from invited researchers and practitioners,
as well as get international contacts in both academia and industry.
\item \textbf{Tutoring}, whereby candidates will be involved in teaching activities
(e.g., supervising student projects and delivering exercises) 
while being coached by their supervisors or other experienced staff.
\item \textbf{Knowledge dissemination and participation to scientific events}, aimed at allowing
doctoral candidates to present and confront their findings, thereby familiarising
themselves with essential practices such as peer-review and public debating.
\item \textbf{External cooperation and secondments}, aimed at ensuring that the candidate
participate actively in another research environment outside his/her home and host universities.
These activities are realised typically with DEDS partner organisations.
\end{itemize}

Please detail in the following subsections your personalised education and training programme,
taking into account your previous background and future career prospects. This programme must
be approved from both co-supervisors.

Activities adding at least 30 ECTS credits must be outlined.
A tabular listing of all activities performed or to be performed during the doctorate project is to be included. Group the activities according to the categories specified above. For each activity, the title, time, location, organiser, and ECTS credits must be included together with an indication of whether the activity has been completed.

\subsubsection*{Section 4.1. Planned Courses}

Courses adding at least 20 ECTS credits must be outlined.

Only courses at doctorate level are approved. If a course at master level is deemed to be highly relevant for the doctorate project, the co-supervisors can establish a study group on the topic, which includes the master course and additional reading/discussion to bring it up to doctorate level. A written report on participation in a study group must be completed to get course credit. To ensure the scientific level, the study circle must be headed by a member of the scientific staff, who is Professor or Associate Professor (senior scientist level). A 2-3 ECTS study circle organised by the co-supervisors on the state of the art in the research field of the doctorate study is recommended.

\subsubsection*{Section 4.2. Knowledge Dissemination and Participation to Scientific Events}

Detail the plan for dissemination of knowledge and findings from the project.\\

This could for instance be:
\begin{itemize}
\item Poster presentations at conferences/seminars.
\item Presentations at conferences/seminars
\item Newspaper articles or other popular presentations
\item Teaching (lecturing and project supervision)
\end{itemize}


%, e.g., newspaper articles, seminars, conference presentations, teaching, etc.
%As seen, dissemination is not only teaching but can also be other activities.

Each participation to scientific events must be accompanied by a written report by the doctorate candidate that relates the specific activity to the doctorate project. This report must be of general value for the project. Activities that relate to workshop and conference participation must not exceed 6 ECTS credits.

\subsubsection*{Section 4.3. External Co-operation}
The doctorate candidate will spend time studying both in Greece `
and Spain. Furthermore, a secondment of three months will take place, where the candidate will join
Spring Techno, where he will work on of a complex Federated Learning scenario with real data.
During the following three years, all ESRs will meet in four different winter/summer schools to present their work, receive feedback, exchange ideas, and get exposed to new challenges. During these schools, candidates will have the opportunity to get in touch with academic and non-academic partners, presenting them their findings, reflecting on new opportunities, and opening the way for further collaboration. Finally, the candidate may co-operate with external researchers or research teams, in case that his work can be combined or merged with similar works of others.

%The doctorate candidate must participate actively in another research environment outside his/her home and host universities.
%Outline a plan for external co-operation (e.g., secondment at a partner organization).
%One or two tentative institutions (others than that of the co-supervisors) must be described. \\
%This should include:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Co-operation with researchers at external/international research environments (typically partner organizations).
%\item Active engagement in external research environments via, e.g., an external stay of 2-3 months.
%Activities of specific significance for the study must be included. Summer schools, conference attendance, etc. are not considered external cooperation. The co-operation must be a research co-operation in which also the visiting institution contributes to the research. The co-operation must be active and it must be with a research institution or a company doing innovation and research.
%\end{itemize}

%Summer schools, conference attendance, etc., are not considered external cooperation.
%The candidate can be awarded with up to 4 ECTS credits based on the Secondment Evaluation Forms of these co-operations.
